This is a reference app for the BigCommerce Marketplace. 

I created this app initially as a live, paid app in the BigCommerce Marketplace. I only ended up getting a few installs
and there were some issues with the way the BC Marketplace handled commissions, even when your app does not collect
anything and is running in a full trial mode.

In the end, I pulled this app from the marketplace, and I'm including this here so that anyone interested in creating a
Flask-based, Python app for BigCommerce Marketplace can reference. Feel free to use and modify.
